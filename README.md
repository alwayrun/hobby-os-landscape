# Projects

## Haiku

Haiku is arguably the most advanced hobby OS that can still reasonably considered a "hobby" project. Started in 2001 and built from a kernel originally written by Travis Geiselbrecht (who would later start the Fuchsia project at Goole), Haiku aims to recreate the experience of BeOS, which had just been discontinued. Haiku boasts a large development team and an impressive final product, with ports of several major applications - including a recent port of LibreOffice. With the rise of 64-bit systems, Haiku has shifted from binary compatibility with BeOS to building their own ABIs with newer compiler toolchains.
